This is an elective course for the taught master program MSc. in _Quantitative Analysis for Business_. This course aims to teach students the theory and applications of quality control, especially in the service industry. Basic statistical knowledge is required to take this course.

May 20, 2020: I will be teaching this course in Semester A of 2020-2021. I am trying to reshape the structure of this course, as I am not entirely happy with its current design.
