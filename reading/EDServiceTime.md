### Abstract


### Introduction

Emergency department (ED) operations are naturally modeled as queueing systems, which requires a good understanding of the demand and service process. Evidences from the existing literature has supported the use of non-stationary Poisson process to model the patient arrival to EDs. However, it remains unclear how to model the service process of patients in the ED.

A distingushing feather of emergency care is that patients return to the same physician multiple times for service.

### Definitions of Service Times
In the literature, different definitions and measures of physician service times have been used.

* Time to disposition (from roomed to disposition decision)
  * This is also the total bed time, right?
* ED length of stay (LOS)
* Pick-to-pick time (P2P time)
* Initial assessment times
* PPH


###### 1. To Batch or Not to Batch? Impact of Admission Batching on Emergency Department Boarding Time and Physician Productivity, by Arshya Feizi, Anita Tucker [\[pdf\]](/files/Tucker_ToBatchorNottoBatch.pdf)

Two productivity measures used in the healthcare operations literature: (1) time to making a disposition decision (akin to discharge rate used in Song et al. 2015); (2) number of patients served (KC et al. 2020)

What is the measure of physician service time (or productivity)?
