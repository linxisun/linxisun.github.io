This paper studies theadmission andscheduling control problem in an $M/M/2$ queueing system with nonidentical processors. Admission control renders when a newly arrived job should be accepted, whereas scheduling control determines when an available processor should be utilized. The system received a rewardR when a job completes its service and pays a unit holding costC while a job is in the system. The main goal of the paper is to obtain the admission/scheduling policy that maximizes the expected discounted and long-run average profits (reward minus cost). We convert the system into its dual, a stochastically identical system subject toexpulsion/scheduling control, and prove that the individually optimal policy in the dual system is socially optimal in the original system.
