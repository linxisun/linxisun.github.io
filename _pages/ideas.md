## Small papers

* Queueing paper: value of information
* OR Letter paper editing
* EJOR paper editing
* Cheng's paper editing

## Working papers
2. Modeling and insights from the time-varying PPH (with H. Ouyang) (Target: **Management Science**)
    * S1: waiting time estimation
    * S2: simulation optimization; shift extension/scheduling
2. Models and simulation of complex systems (with H. Ouyang) (Target: **Operations Research**)
  * S1: perturbation theory, mean-field method, diffusion approximation
  * S2: consider LWBS, priority estimation
  * S3: show how does the scaling parameter affect the accuracy
3. ED staffing with PPH; A time-varying queueing system; Uniformization (with SJTU) (Target: **Operations Research**)

## Ongoing


1. FT routing modeling paper: proof of results; try different patient classifications and compare their performances (by admit, LOS, chance of FT) (Target: with the redundancy modeling, we can try **Operations Research**)
    * **Perhaps we can consider a shadow patient**, with a focus on CTAS3, or patients in the middle. Refer to two papers in Notability. This could be a nice queueing analysis.
7. ED patient prioritization (Target: **Management Science**)
    1. Choice model: waiting for room (patient chosen by nurses)
    1. Choice model: initial assessment (patient chosen by physicians)
    1. Non-aligned objectives might lead to inefficiency
    2. The impact on patient outcome (LOS, revisit, LWBS)
6. Waiting time prediction with patient prioritization (Target: perhanps **MSOM**)

## Next step
1. ED dual-bottlenecks: Bed + Physicians
    1. Stochastic modeling (SOQN, Jia and Heragu 2009, Operations Research)
    1. Fluid model (MMFQ, Carmen et al. 2018, EJOR, Chan's OR paper)
    1. So-what: ED surging plan
2. ED specialist: stochastic clearing system [\[PDF\]](/files/He-StochasticClearingSystem.pdf)
3. With Lishuai:
    * Urban air mobility (UAM)
    * Data from Cathy Pacific: optimize then predict
    * Delay estimation in a airport network (mean field theory)
4. Patient LWBS in emergency departments [\[PDF\]](/files/NONLINEAR PROGRAMMING METHOD FOR DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING.pdf)
    * Doubly-censored data
    * What are the driving factors? Of course, waiting time; but what else? Social injustice? Chaotic environment?
    * From Larson 1087, Skips and Slips: At least three attributes other than queueing delay paly key roles in a customer's queueing experiene: social justice, queueing environment, and feedback about delays.
    * A discrete choice dynamic programming model [\[PDF\]](https://web.stanford.edu/~chand04/papers/eos_paper.pdf)
    * Structural Estimation of Callers' Delay Sensitivity in Call
Centers [\[PDF\]](/files/MS_2013_Aksin_Ata_Emadi_Su_Structural estimation.pdf)
5. Healthcare referal system: an optimal control framework
