* Prof. Raik Stolletz[(website)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=moQsvVoAAAAJ&hl=en)

## Small papers

* Queueing paper: value of information
* Cheng's paper editing
* OR Letter paper editing
* EJOR paper editing

## Working papers
1. FT routing paper: writing, new simulation, conclusion (Target: **Management Science**)
2. ED staffing with PPH: waiting time estimation; modeling the time-varying PPH (Target: **Operations Research**)
    * Extension 1: consider priority in waiting time estimation
    * Extension 2: consider network effect
4. Medical paper: the impact of ED census on ED decision making (consider different measures of blocking, such as boarding time of the previous $n$ patients) (Target: **Medical journal**)

## Ongoing


1. FT routing modeling paper: proof of results; try different patient classifications and compare their performances (by admit, LOS, chance of FT) (Target: with the redundancy modeling, we can try **Operations Research**)
    * **Perhaps we can consider a shadow patient**, with a focus on CTAS3, or patients in the middle. Refer to two papers in Notability. This could be a nice queueing analysis.
7. ED patient prioritization (Target: **Management Science**)
    1. Choice model: waiting for room (patient chosen by nurses)
    1. Choice model: initial assessment (patient chosen by physicians)
    1. Non-aligned objectives might lead to inefficiency
    2. The impact on patient outcome (LOS, revisit, LWBS)
6. Waiting time prediction with patient prioritization (Target: perhanps **MSOM**)

## Next step
1. ED double bottlenecks: Bed + Physicians
    1. Stochastic modeling (SOQN, Jia and Heragu 2009, Operations Research)
    1. Fluid model (MMFQ, Carmen et al. 2018, EJOR); refer to Chan's OR paper; maybe we could perform similar analysis.
    1. Perturbation analysis
    1. So-what: ED surging plan
3. ED specialist: stochastic clearing system [\[PDF\]](/files/He-StochasticClearingSystem.pdf)
4. With Lishuai:
    * Drone delivery
    * Data from Cathy Pacific: optimize then predict
