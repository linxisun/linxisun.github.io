## Tasks

* Queueing paper: value of information
* Cheng's paper editing
* OR Letter paper editing
* EJOR paper editing
* Chinook paper

## Ongoing

1. FT routing paper: writing, new simulation, conclusion **submit by February 2021**
2. FT routing modeling paper: proof of results; try different patient classifications and compare their performances (by admit, LOS, chance of FT)
    * **Perhanps we can consider a shadow patient**, with a focus on CTAS3, or patients in the middle. Refer to two papers in Notability.
4. Medical paper: the impact of ED census on ED decision making (consider different measures of blocking, such as boarding time of the previous $n$ patients)
5. ED staffing with PPH: waiting time estimation
6. Waiting time prediction with patient prioritization

## Next step
1. ED patient prioritization
    1. Choice model: waiting for room (patient chosen by nurses)
    1. Choice model: initial assessment (patient chosen by physicians)
    1. Non-aligned objectives might lead to inefficiency
2. ED double bottlenecks: Bed + Physicians
    2. Stochastic modeling (SOQN, Jia and Heragu 2009, Operations Research)
    2. Fluid model (MMFQ, Carmen et al. 2018, EJOR)
    2. Perturbation analysis
    2. So-what: ED surging plan
3. ED specialist: stochastic clearing system [\[PDF\]](/files/He-StochasticClearingSystem.pdf)
4. With Lishuai:
    * Drone delivery
    * Data from Cathy Pacific: optimize then predict
5. Clean energy with Xiaowei
