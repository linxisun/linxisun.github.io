I am a primary 5 student studying at [Kowloon Tong School (Primary Section)](https://www.ktsps.edu.hk/eng/index.html) in Hong Kong. I am a big fan of sports, including badminton, track and field, and others. I love reading. My favourite book is Matilda, a children's novel by British author [Roald Dahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald_Dahl).
